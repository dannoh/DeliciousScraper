# DeliciousScraper
This is just a quick utility I created to rip my bookmarks off of http://del.icio.us/ before it dies for good.

It only does public bookmarks (since mine were all public).  It has basically no defensive programming, but it imported all mine without issue.  

Outputs a bookmarks.html file that is in the Netscape format which is apparently universal.  Worked perfectly importing to https://pinboard.in
